For the last couple of months I have been working on video that explores some of the potential Google Glass has for retail. In the coming weeks I will discuss some of the features and ideas in hopes of fostering some debate and discussion about their application and how they will affect retailers. I would love to hear any thoughts and comments you have, feel free to get in touch through any of the usual social networks ([Twitter](http://twitter.com/crstanier), [Linkedin](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/cstanier/), [GooglePlus](https://plus.google.com/+CurtisStanier)) or by email to hello [at] crstanier.co.uk

I want to include a massive thank you to all the retailers that are featured in this video. Their teams, both at head office and in store, were fantastic throughout. Obviously, all comments are my own and do not represent the views of any of the companies shown.
