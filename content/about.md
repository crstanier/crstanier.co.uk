Iâ€™m a recent graduate with a passion for technology and business.

I believe that technology is the start of smarter businesses. I want to grow a career in which I can help businesses grow and utilise the potential of a data-driven world. I understand the importance of strong relationships in business and always strive to exceed standards and expectations of those I work with and for. I have a strong track record of leading and inspiring others to operational excellence and profit growth through logical process refinement and positive working culture.

I currently live in Jersey, the Channel Islands and work as a Technologist and Developer. I help companies adopt technology appropriately into their business and build some cool web based apps too.
